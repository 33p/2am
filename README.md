## Extra stuff

Not a fan of some of the color choices used in this theme? No worries, [Code makes it easy to customize](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color).

That sweet looking font in the screenshot is [Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code).

Bracket coloring comes from the supercool [Bracket Pair Colorizer 2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2) extension, with some custom colors added to `settings.json`:
